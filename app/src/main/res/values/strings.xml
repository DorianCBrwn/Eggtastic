<li>Place eggs in the bottom of a saucepan</li>
<li> Heat on high heat and bring the water to a full rolling boil. <em><strong>Optional:</strong>Adding 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the water will make the eggs easier to peel and help to prevent the shells from cracking.</em></li>
<li>Turn off the heat, keep the pan on the hot burner, cover with a pot lid. Then the eggs let sit in the hot water for 10-12 minutes. <em>Larger eggs / larger pots may increase cook time by a few extra minutes.</em></li>
<li> Drain the water from the pot and run cold water over the eggs to cool them and to stop them from cooking.<em> The eggs should be easier to peel once cooled down to room temperature. </em></li>
